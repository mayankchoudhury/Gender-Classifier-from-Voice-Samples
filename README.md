## Overview
The following Python code is a simple example of predicting a given set of data from a trained set of Decision Tree, where the data can be of any kind of values.

The data set used here can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender

## About the code
The dependencies used here are :

-> numpy

-> scipy

-> scikit-learn


Depencies can be installed by the command format pip install numpy via the Terminal


Learn more about scikit-learn from here : http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/

Details about the methods used in the code can be found here : http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html

Give your tested sample data to be classified in the variable 'inputprediction' to get the closest prediction according to the give data sets.

And finally run your code from terminal using the command Python VoiceClassifier.py
