## Overview
The following code is a simple example of predicting a given set of data from a trained set of Decision Tree, where the data can be of any kind of values.

## About the code
The dependencies used here are :

-> numpy

-> scipy

-> scikit-learn


Depencies can be installed by the command format pip install numpy via the Terminal


Learn more about scikit-learn from here : http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/

Details about the methods used in the code can be found here : http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html


And finally run your code from terminal using the command Python VoiceClassifier.py
